# My Personal Library

## Project Goals & Scope

### Goals

This project has two primary goals:

1. Keeping track of my physical library by creating a catelogue of the specific versions of every book on my bookself.
2. Improving my knowledge and experience with the MERN techstack

### Scope

This web application will have the following features and functionalities:

* User sign up and sign in. (Despite the inception of this project being about my own personal library, I want to teach myself sign in/signup functionality - including authorization and authentication).
* Search functionality. Users will be able to search a database for specific versions of their books - this can be achieved by using an API and specific ISBN numbers.
* Users will be able to view all the details about their books, including, but not limited to:
    * Title
    * Author
    * Date of Publication
    * Current version publication
    * Number of Pages
    * Cover Image

* Users will be able to store and categorise books in a database that will act as their library.
* Users will be able to mark books as unread, read, currently reading.
* Users will be able to update the progress of their currently reading books.
* Users will be able to rate their books and write reviews.

What falls outside of the project's scope for the moment:
* Other users or visitors to the site will not be able to view other's books.
* Users will not have the option for 'want to read books' - as this web application is only for the store of books of a user's bookshelf.

## TODO: Write Learning Journey

Learning a new techstack as a not-quite-beginner software developer is a challenging thing. While there are many great free courses out there, a lot of them are targeted towards either complete beginners or advanced programmers. Tutorials can be viable options for those wanting to create new projects and develop skills, however, I have found that these are often paint-by-numbers coding where I don't actually learn anything or try anything new. 

That is why I've decided to create my
